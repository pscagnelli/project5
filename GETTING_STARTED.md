# Getting Started

## Overview
This project is organized around exploratory notebooks for stock prediction and portfolio management. Use this guide to set up your environment and work through the notebooks in a sensible order.

## Recommended Environment
- Python 3.9+ (via `pyenv`, `conda`, or system Python)
- JupyterLab or VS Code with the Jupyter extension
- Common data stack: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Deep learning stack for time-series: `tensorflow` or `pytorch`
- NLP stack for sentiment analysis: `nltk`, `spacy`, or `transformers`

## Suggested Notebook Order
1. **Project 5 Time series.ipynb** — introduces time-series framing and forecasting ideas.
2. **Project 5 Sentiment.ipynb** — explores sentiment analysis as a predictive signal.
3. **PCA project 5.ipynb** — applies PCA techniques for portfolio construction.

## Tips for Extending the Project
- Add more features: technical indicators, macro variables, or alternative data.
- Compare models: baseline regressions vs. LSTM vs. transformer-based time-series models.
- Evaluate portfolios: add Monte Carlo simulations or stress tests across market regimes.
- Track experiments: save model configs and results for reproducibility.
